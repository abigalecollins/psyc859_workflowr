## Project Topic
The data used in the PSYC 859 assignment will be taken from a larger study conducted by the Developmental Neuroscience and Personality Disorders (DEPENd) Lab at UNC-CH. PI: Dr. Michael Hallquist. 
The broad study aim is to investigate the impact of social influences on decision-making in individuals with and without symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD). This course project will focus on behavioral task data collected during a study visit. The task goal (and the goal of this project) will be to understand how BPD symptomology may impact the effect of Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer on responses to both social and nonsocial cues.
